# sorting-algorithms-visualizer
This project visualizes popular sorting algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort. The visualization is achieved by sorting a collection of different height bars and seeing the sorting process on the collection of bars in real time. 
This project has various interactive elements. The first is a pause/play feature that allows users to stop and play a sorting algorithm as they please. Another feature is the slider that allows users to choose how many bars they want to sort.
